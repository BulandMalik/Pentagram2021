# ADR_01: A dedicated user activation service subscribing to purchase events from Farmacy Foods

# Status: 
Proposed

# Context:
A primary goal of the project is converting transactational customers to Farmacy Family engaged customers. Farmacy Foods publishes all purchase transactions to a kafka stream. Starting with the basic functionality of sending emails to users who complete a transaction, this service can extended to add the following functionality 
1. We will need to reach these customers as soon as possible after they make a transaction and  2. keep track of who has already been activated or 
3. when we reached out to the customer last time to not be too pushy. 
4. Also to keep track of how active a customer is.
